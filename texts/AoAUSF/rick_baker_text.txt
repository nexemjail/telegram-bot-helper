Just returned from a vacation with friends when I was tired of being social,I drew this.#drawing #TheManWhoLaughs  
Eye,Eye,Eye. Digital eye test modeled and rendered in #MODO composited in #AfterEffects  
East meets West Monstermaker style. Keizo Murase, me, Shinichi Wakasa.
Mr Murase and Shinchi both are Godzillamakers  
If this book is half as good as his doc it will be great!  
Close up  shot of my #Frankenstein #Puppet  
Here is the link to the better quality video on Youtube,You can see better it though it looks darker than it is . 
Put some of the WIP shots for my #Frankenstein movie together to see how they look.I'll post HD on youtube soon.  
Another shot of my #Frankenstein #Puppet close up head.I played with the color in the photo. Head is about1/2 scale  
Put his eyes in and started painting,more 2 go.Snapped this shot before retiring thought it looked cool so ill post  
Another drawing, mostly done yesterday. Again bumped up the contrast added small highlights and vignette digitally.  
Another pencil drawings. I adjusted the contrast,added small white highlights and vignette digitally.  
1 of the unfinished sketches I have been working on.
 Having fun using a pencil and paper. Haven't done that in ages  
Making Eyes,for my larger Frankenstein puppet.  
Haven't posted much lately. I've been making models for the Lab exterior,making eyes, casting heads,drawing,trying to learn MODO.Soon though
@vin1fx I seem to remember seeing some in Dick's files back in the day but, maybe I am just making that up.
@vin1fx Yes he did,as this proves.
RT @headgeek666: Happy Birthday To Lon Chaney Sr!  This is just a small example of his badassery:  
This time animated the machines in the BG and tried some different stuff. Watch this Video  
I think you guys are getting tired of my Frankenstein,so I'll post another shot of my #New52Joker  #makeUp #DC  
More stuff in the lab. I'm thinking color now. Watch the video here
https://t.co/X9tMfHD2BY
Lab +contents in # MODO  
All along I have been thinking B+W but I'm kind of liking the color.It means more careful texturing though.#MODO wip  
Same shot of the monster but added more stuff in the lab and used displacement maps on the walls.Still a Wip
#MODO  
Wanted to see the puppet in the CG environment to see if I needed to use displacement maps instead of bump. Yes I do  
I got smart and had my friend Rob Freitas,master mold maker, make the mold for the larger head.  
@JesseMeriwether Yah I agree with B
Did she notice my cameo as the wolfman's first kill ?
I wanted to see the machines working so I animated a little shot using particles for sparks. Again all in #MODO  
35 years ago today according to American Werewolf expert Paul Davis and this call sheet,we shot Jacks death scene  
The cleaned up wax cast from the #3DPrint of my larger #Frankenstein  
RT @el_zombo: Happy Birthday Dwight Iliff Frye (February 22, 1899 – November 7, 1943)  
More stuff for the lab table.Spent more time texturing the foreground OBJ so I blurred the BG ones in PS #MODO  
@AnatomyFX I don't think it is necessary the shrinkage isn't that bad, like foam latex.
Don't touch that lever you'll blow us all to atoms!! More #Modo madness for my #FrankensteinLab  
@PrestonAltree No. Modeled and rendered in #MODO
Made a table for the monster in #MODO it's a cross between the 1931 Frankenstein and the Evil of Frankenstein table  
@JesseMeriwether I sculpted molded and cast and finished puppets. Mostly for Davey and Goliath .The Gumby episodes finished shortly after

Took a photo of the almost done puppet to see if the colors would work with chroma key.This was the result.A WIP
@tonya_traylor 
A bit
@tonya_traylor 
Glad he is in a good home. I believe they were Futaba  receivers and controllers. He was made 20 some years ago so not sure
Another #MODO model and render made for my #Frankenstein #puppet  
@malkosh 
Didn't know there was such a thing
While Lou was making the costume parts yesterday I modeled and rendered this in #MODO
Still need to age these up .  
LouElsey started the pants and sleves today.I took a quick photo thought why not stick the machine in it.Still a WIP  
My #MODO skills are kind of rusty .Here is one of the almost fin machines that I modeled for my Frankenstein puppet

It doesn't print wax,I molded the 3D print and cast a wax
@agraphafx @FrankIppolito mechanical
@FrankIppolito Made them in a CAD program then printed them on my MakerBot
Started cleaning up and detailing the larger wax head. 
More fun than trying to get the supports of of the 3D print.

@DerekRoyals the big head on a cube pro, photo of it printing in my previous post .the small one on a makerbot replicator 2
30 hours of printing I got this.Didn't print at the highest resolution .I'm going to remold ,cast wax clean that up.  
@mm_nm_mn Study sculpture ,mold making ,painting,CGI, learn as much as you can about everything. Work hard every day to improve.
@mm_nm_mn Start when you are ten years old and work  really hard.
@ImensMiniatures Hi Mark. it's filament
@EMannLand 
A lot!
@SERGIOSANCHEZW yes
@_TheAngryGinger This print will take about 24 hours
@Blizzard08 Thanks but no thanks.
Printing a larger head, for closeups, of my #frankenstein on my new sexy #CubePro3DPrinter  
@aprilbay53 sorry but I never lived in victoria Don't know what you are talking about
I saw #JohnFogarty in concert in Vagas . Awesome ! His son Shane is in the band seeing the 2 of them rocking out brought tears to my eyes

It depends on the effect you are going for .They both don't look good until you trim and dress the hair.

@JesseMeriwether Colored make up and filters .Very clever transformation.Many techniques used  .Too hard to explain in this many words.
I spent the holidays in #Iceland  Icelandic people were all so nice. I back now and about to return to my puppet.  
RT @RickReeseLaird: @TheRickBaker The man truly deserved this role... on many levels.  
@JesseMeriwether The wolf man1941,Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde the Fredric March version.Island of Lost Souls with Charles Laughton. Mad Love
Same head #keyshot render. Watch this video  
I managed to fit in some time to finish theZBrush version of the head more,since I am going to re print and scale it  
This shows his size.  
I love the way things look right after they get printed and before the supports are taken off.  
If I stuck to my plan scaling up the head would not be a big deal but, I 3D printed ,molded and cast in wax then I resculpted and remolded
The unfinished puppet.I wanted him to have strange proportions but now think maybe the arms r 2 long and head 2small  
Won't be able to work on him for about 2 weeks. Tried a walk in this video Hard to do alone. 
Just saw #StarWarsTheForceAwakens
 LOVED  Everything about it !!.
 Way to go #JJAbrams
I'm having so much fun working on this puppet!  
Happy Birthday To my friend and helper for so many years Bill Sturgeon. He was 18 years old when he worked on American Werewolf with me.
Finally got most of the parts printed and cast now starting to put him together.  
I'm overwhelmed by the number of birthday wishes I received yesterday. I appreciate the nice words and thoughts. Thanks you.
Thanks for the birthday wishes .I guess as of today I am officially a senior citizen. How did that happen so fast?
@Fargo3DPrinting 
Yes I got all that I needed and everything is working fine now.  Thanks again
@Fargo3DPrinting My Makerbot stopped working. Went to their site looking for replacement parts and help.Struck out,thankfully I found you.
Got a first pull out of the mold and did a quick paint test #Frankenstein #puppet  
 
RT @el_zombo: Happy Birthday #BorisKarloff (November, 23 1887 – February 2, 1969)  
OK more of todays days work.After dinner and visiting with the family,I had to get back to this.Did a ZB BPR + PS  
Todays work.He is going to be a rod puppet. I'm 3D printing the head hands and boots. The rest will be fabricated  
I'm going to start making a puppet of the Jack Davis 6 ft Frankenstein. Going to make it look more like Karloff though.
@goldiestarling OK so it was you,when you didn't say anything I thought that maybe you weren't you and I just seemed like a creepy guy.

Unlike when I was a kid there is a bunch of info out there on the net.
A ton of youtube videos I have a couple.
Don't worry I will continue making monsters as long as my old body will let me. I just had 3months of chores to catch up on.
Kind of having Halloween withdrawal, back to "normal" life doing chores around the house.
I want to make some monsters!
If my Dad were still alive, today would have been his birthday ,wait I guess today is still his day of birth alive or not. Best Dad ever!

The fun part. My idea of a good time, making up my family and having my family help on Halloween.  
Now for the not so fun part cleaning up the mess. It was fun giving out all of this candy though.  
Happy Halloween,I was going to wait but.. My other daughter Rebecca and her boyfriend Kyle  
It's 6:30am Halloween!,I'm scarfing down my breakfast smoothie then I start make-ups. Me first then the rest of my fam. Good times.

Friday I make up my daughter Veronica to go to work. We'll post a photo of her then.
@VeeLadwa @HeroComplexArt @TrailersFromHel 
Thanks for making these beauties .Love them! Rick
I thought all of the contestants rose to the occasion and did a great job!
I enjoyed seeing PatrickTatopoulos guiding the contestants and directing the short films.Putting the contestants in a real filming situation
Last night's #FaceOff was what the show should be imo . Give the contestants time to do a decent job and  actually use the make ups on film.
Congratulations @Nora_Hewitt , when Glen said your name I cheered out loud.Your positive attitude won me over,and will serve you well
@The_Evil_Ed work really hard and don't give up
Took a break have a cup of tea,turned on the TV and '76 Kong was on. I remember it like it was yesterday .It was almost 40years ago.eeek
Check out the cool artwork  
You can see  my friend Tarina's pink hair reflected in my painting in this shot she took at the @HeroComplexArt show  
Ok I was kidding, her middle name isn't Gizmo ,it's Mohawk.
We almost named her Gismo but came to our senses and just made it her middle name.
Me @joe_dante  and my beautiful daughter @veronicabaker who was born on Gremlins2 at the @herocomplexart  show.  
I'm touched that so many artists spent the time to do such great work as a tribute to this old guy who turned his hobby into his profession.
I was touched by all of the great art at the @herocomplexart show tribute to me.Thanks to all who participated.  
One of my paintings in the @HeroComplexArt tribute to me show  
I enjoyed talking to everyone who came out for the screening last night. I am really looking forward to seeing all of the art work today.

Oh you are so wrong. You should see the mess I made today doing my make up test. I so want to show you all what I've done.
@Help_TEAM_CHUCK 
Tell your students that I always test my make ups usually several times.It takes practice to get good at it. Practice
So far I have tested 3 of my halloween makeups, I test mine tomorrow. I'm excited to show you guys but I will have to wait until halloween.
This is disturbing and creepier than it should be.

This is very creepy.

@VICSHADEZ 
I was on the first two shows last year.I would come back.
All I can say is I wouldn't want to have to compete on #FaceOff so much pressure so little time.
They all did great on the 1st challenge
Great to see Eryn on #faceoff. Agree with the judges on the winner.Congrats to Ben and Jorden, close 2nd Nora and Jasmine.Disagree on loser
@JesseMeriwether 
Nice clean job Jesse. What is it made of?
@JesseMeriwether 
I feel her pain.I'm facing the same situation now working on my Halloween make ups using #monsterclay after just using WED
34years ago I was watching American Werewolf with an audience for the 1st time,they stood up and cheered after the transformation
Prettycool

No wonder I look so old,34 years ago,seems like yesterday.
@RicardoElorza 
I'm dying to post photos but can't until after Halloween. We never let anyone know what we are doing until Halloween.
I'm having so much fun working on my family's halloween make ups, sculpting, making molds, making teeth, just like the old days.
@scottstoybox @Sabine_Delphine 
Ok you don't have to pay for dinner.
@scottstoybox congrats on tonight's win on #FaceOff . I agree with the judges choice. Nice to have Lois back too.
@scottstoybox OK get the other guys together and I'm there.
@RAMaterials @CreatureFrank I would like to be at that dinner!
OK back to Halloween stuff. More to come on this guy later  
I was working on Halloween stuff and these two unpainted casts were staring at me, so I started to paint one.  
On this day twenty two years my beautiful daughter Rebecca was born and changed my life for the better. Happy birthday Rebecca, I love you.
@vurt2169 
It has been my pleasure and honor to do so. Thank you
Happy ninth birthday Bella!
@JesseMeriwether 
Yes,never thought we made it but adding eyebrows helped a lot.
@ARTofCOOP 
Hi Coop, I would too but that will cost a bunch this has already cost too much.
I do think the 1st one I paint will be bronzlike
Danny got the first cast out. I'm busy getting ready for Halloween don't know when I can get around to finishing it.

@brendanpascal I thought you were talking about my slippers
Me inthe80's with a gorilla statue I made for Landis.Good pose Rick,I guess I wanted to show off my bedroom slippers  
@MissPurpleSocks I love this film!
@BrintinBaker Yah I figured I just needed to get this molded quick as the clay was drying and I am probably only going to cast one or two
My friend Danny has started the mold on my sculpt.  
@MikeVanderbilt 
Octaman is often used in films when they need a bad monster movie on TV. Hey you have to start somewhere.
@JesseMeriwether 
Can't wait to hear her answer. Is she free some day next week for me to show her some stuff.
Well, I'm going to have to call this guy done. I would have liked to refine the sculpt and details a lot more but...  
Need to finish this guy today as I have to start getting ready for Halloween.  
Yesterday I started the texture on the neck and hand and I am refining the forms as I do so.  
A year ago today the master Dick Smith,left us.
How he looks today. Tired of sculpting little lines and I have the body to go still.  
Started some skin detail,probably too soon, as usual.I need to follow my own advice and get the forms all there first  
@MichaelTabb @billprady @Comic_Con It was a great get together!
@AveryChasten You know a while back I went through a period where I put spikes into everything,so I think I'm over that,but I was thinking..
@lawrencem49 I think he is too cartoony for that at least his face is. Hs face is more like a topstone mask from the 60 that WD material
Ok I lied,I did get to work on this some today, just not as much as I would have liked.Took these to see what I did  
@gerfromjersey Never too late to learn.
@el_zombo Cool shot!  I have never seen it before.
@JesseMeriwether When I finish this, and before B goes back to school,we should have a play day and I can show her some sculpting techniques
I won't to be able to sculpt  today so I was looking at photos , how different the same sculpt looks from this side  
@BrintinBaker Hi Brent, Thanks for posting a photo of younger me to make me feel old. Hope all is well with you.
@Kurt_Dirt Yes the same.It is what the great Disney sculptor Blane Gibson, who just passed,used to sculpt all of the animatronic figures
I couldn't remember the last time I did a sculpt in wed clay, then a friend send me this , me helping Chris Walas  
@Veevvz 
No I don't always start with a skull.I didn't know what I was going to sculpt,just felt like pushing some clay around,so I started
Today's evolution  
Progress on the hand .  
@alexanderhindle I'm enjoying progressing with it. Haven't touched WED clay in ages. Really having fun seeing where it takes me.
@Kinneas  This is old school, Wed clay
@el_zombo No, it's not. it is my x-wife in a make up that I did. Thanks for the complement though.
Same sculpt different angle  
Started wetting down and wrapping up the sculpt for the day,thought it looked interesting like this so I took this.  
Didn't get much time today to work on this but managed to loosely block out a hand and get a little more emotion in .  
@gerfromjersey You calling me a ghoul? : )
I was thinking of adding a hand to the sculpt so I took this photo for reference, as I was looking in a mirror .  
This is where the sculpture took me today. I wish there was a revert button in real world sculpting, like in digital  
@ARQLIZCANO @KariByron Been trying to learn #MODO801 #Element3D some new features in #AfterEffects new stuff in #Zbrush and #Keyshot
Where the sculpt gone today.Lots more to do  
Worked on this after dinner this is Where it's at tonight. Still lots more to do.

Wow 28 years ago. Hard to believe. Still one of my favorite  of my creations.
Played a bit with my Joker 52  and made this #Joker52gif  #DCComics  
#IncredibleMeltingMan Melts  
Tried making a gif of a morph from the B+W werewolf painting to the color.Now I'll see if it worked.  
@baskervilleman I painted this 45 years ago so I don't totally recall. I do remember that it was acrylic. One by one,most likely.
#smallworld An actor friend goes into his managers office and this painting that I did when I was 19 is hanging there  
Here is what happened to my B+W #Werewolf of London painting after painting the color version, now digital tweeks  
@deanareeno 
Yes it's a dummy we made.
@perlmutations @amnethyst2002 To old to race ,just moseying towards the glue factory.Before I get there , I want to do a Vincent painting
@amnethyst2002 Vincent would be nothing without @perlmutations interesting unique face, and his amazing acting ability.
@vincentdonofrio  Hey thanks Buddy, I like you too. I just did an interview where I talked about how patient and amazing u were to work with
@JesseMeriwether 
Bella is so right and so wise for a girl of her age.
I want you all to know that I will continue creating for as long as I am able to.  I am excited for this new chapter of my life.
I'm so surprised and touched by the number of tweets about my retirement. Thanks you all. I feel loved and appreciated.Who could ask 4 more
Here is a color version of my #WerewolfOfLondon #painting .I think it lost a little something that the B+W had.

That brings back memories! thanks
@HisForgotenSoul @GregCapullo 
They look great!
@JesseMeriwether Not a good idea could break the cast.
Heat up the gelatin first then drip it on. Maybe a hair dryer but not a heat gun
Close-up of my version of @GregCapullo great design for #Joker52.
Done in #zbrush #keyshot #photoshop
#DCcomics  
Ok,I'm calling my #DCcomics  #Joker52 Done for now..@GregCapullo hope I did him justice .#Zbrush #Keyshot #photoshop

Happy birthday to my old friend Bob Burns.
Started working on a #JOKER52  #Zbrush took a few liberties with @GregCapullo cool design,hope you don't mind Greg.  
I wanted to show that I don't always paint grotesque things. I wanted to paint my wife but I don't think I could capture her beauty.
Happy mother's day .Here is a painting that I did for my wife for her birthday ,which is also today, of our dog.  
@FrankIppolito 
I should make some new casts from the original molds
@creaturegeddon  Can't this year,maybe next year
@zilla92 I might but they probably won't be on canvas, since this was painted on canvas the texture would be doubled up.
More of the same #Zbrush #Keyshot #PS .Worked on the sculpt more,not finished,Still want to paint it and add material  
@maeday02 
In all honesty I can't really recommend the school now that Dick is gone.I don't know what it has become.
@PHILAN_TROPHIST 
Are you calling me a Masterbaker? :)
Still goofing around with #Zbrush and #Keyshot and a little #aftereffects  
@agraphafx 
Cool! I also used them on my last ZB piece. They were actually the first alphas that I ever made.
@el_zombo 
No big deal. I really enjoy seeing all of the stuff you post.
@el_zombo Joe Johnston did not direct Chaney Jr in Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein which these photos are from.
@el_zombo This looks like a test make up. I don't think it is what appeared in the film.The make up is the film was less extreme
Having fun with #ZBrush using the bridge to #keyshot  lots more to do on this guy.  
@loganladdie Make up FX use to be such a boys club, I am happy by the fact that girls can join now too.
@loganladdie Sorry, I was impressed with what you did as well especially in the final show. I don't know how all of you do so much so quick
Congrats to all of the #faceoff finalists. Laura great job coaching  @Darla_Edin you continued to do clean creative make ups,not big masks.
@VMeganJArt not in the limited space here but it hasn't really changed that much. We used silicone pieces on Edgar and used silicone in 2012
@annavictrola 
I hate when that happens, I bet most of the other stuff is not their work too. thanks for letting me know
Another less slimy reader of this guy. #zbrush #keyshot  
#Zbrush and #Keyshot fun again with an old model of a mask that I originally made as a kid , later used in #starwars  
Younger Days.Making up Jack stage2 for #AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon  
Congrats  @emilyserpico on your well deserved win on this week's #FaceOff .
Again the girls rule. You are a clever and creative young lady.
More #ZBrush to #Keyshot fun. This time with my old Schlitzie model. Still don't really know how to use keyshot right  
RT @propstore_com: Our no reserve #RickBakerauction of 400+ Rick Baker treasures takes place on 29 May! Pre-order the catalog at  
Got the latest version of #zbrush with the #Keyshot bridge,tried out an old Ztool of Bela .I'm excited to try more.  
@DrakereidusJim Thanks! i'm flattered
The girls are showing up the boys again on #FaceOff 
Too bad there can't be 2 winners because both Darla &amp; Emily knocked it out of the park
Happy Birthday Lon !  
@GhostCircuitry @Intenzeink @fkirons

Are you saying that the big nose is inspired by Rick Baker? :)
Here is what I have so for on the #Zombie animation
Zombie:  
@darrenhayes 
Good eye, yes it started out as a photo of me from #Thriller which I then photoshopped a bunch.
Here is a frame from the animation that I am working on now.  
More Messing around with #photoshop and #AfterEffects. A bit gross! CorpseBride:

@ebruhwiler 
Cool stuff thanks for showing me.
I did an animation test of my Regan painting .Check this out if you dare! Animated Exorcist Painting:  
@JesseMeriwether I have done both.
@Goatboy667 See I do have a brain. I've never looked better. Thanks @GoatBoy667
@Goatboy667 Very cool!!! 
 Love them. Did I see my head in there? think so. Great stuff!
@Goatboy667 Hey Goatboy,
I skimmed through your photos and there are some outrageously cool images here that you did.I'm going to look more
Video of me painting my #Exorcist #oilpainting  
Congratulations on your oscar win for best make up #FrancesHannon and #MarkCoulier .Thanks for the Dick Smith shout out Mark.
Thinking of the master #DickSmith today so I painted this. Nice shout outs for Dick on the #Oscars tonight.  
@myk_saiten @Mummsyandzomb 
No CG back in those days.We had to invent ways to do things that have never been done before.I miss those days
@ChristianSculpt 
They were a great source of info back in the day.
@soshollywood 
I don't know of a training center for kids for make up.I suggest  library books and she could watch my youtube makeup videos.
Here is the time lapse video of me painting "The Curse of Frankenstein" painting  
Someone asked for a photo of me working on Sidney,from #TheIncredibleShrinkingWoman
So here you go.I was 27 here.  
Good to see my old friend @actordougjones  on #FaceOff .
Congrats @jaeraele . Nice job
I actually like the yellow too, I got the painting to this point then looked up the Gogos one, yellow and orange BG. It looks too similar
Started  #CurseOfFrankenstein #Painting.The yellow BG has to go it looks like a bad copy Gogos painting at the moment  
Here is the video of me painting myself.
RickBaker paints self alla prima oil:  
Worked on this about an hour more.Managed to make myself look even more pissed off. Painting my reflection is hard.  
@MarkTavares 
Doesn't look anything like the Shock Monster :)
Glad to inspire creativity.
@robertslover55
 I make that serious face when I am concentrating and I squint . So that is what I was seeing in the mirror.
I decided at 10 pm to do a quick self portrait on Friday the 13th stopped at midnight.  Its tough!  
@marginal_error @GeorgeTroester @FaceOffSyfy
 Too frightening !! An insult to apes
@GeorgeTroester @FaceOffSyfy 
Maybe next time. What kind of crazy ape is that?
@Brokenrocketart 
Just do something every day. I have lists of stuff that I want to create. If I am at a loss, I look at the list. Set goals
@SiGunn1 Thanks. Hard to explain but it was a rubber screen around a Plexiglas Box which we rear projected the image and pumped air in &amp;out
@JesseMeriwether Agreed, and she is smart too. I am lucky man.
@gddesign75 
I paint for me.I keep the originals but you can buy fine art prints at Halloween Town of some of my other paintings
@el_zombo 
I don't really follow anyone as there is not enough time in the day as it is but, I had to follow you these are too much fun.
Here is the video of me painting the Shock Monster.  
@JesseMeriwether 
Nothing more that what you said. you gave he perfect advice.
The girls are kicking ass again on #FaceOff 
Congrats Stephanie and Kelly .
Regina ,sorry to see my old hair go.
In an effort to loosen up my painting style I did a #speedpainting of the classic Topstone
#ShockMonster mask.  
The video of my #AmericanWerewolf  #Painting   
My technique seems to be put some paint on then correct my mistakes .
Didn't paint last night ,I went to the amazing #MusiCares event honoring #BobDylan. What a great evening thanks Betty and Bob @apogeedigital
I managed to get this far after dinner. Tired , I'll revisit it tomorrow night.#AmericanWerewolfInLondon #oilpainting  
I have to do grown up stuff today,damn grown up stuff!Tonight I am hoping to paint my Wolf from #AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon if I'm not tired
@Darla_Edin Your welcome! What I really liked about yours was,it was a make-up not a big mask which is what everyone on the show seems to do
Watched #FaceOff the girls are kicking ass!Congrats @emilyserpico on your well deserved win. @Darla_Edin nicely finished make up,close one.
Thanks for looking at the video of me painting the Werewolf of London ,Rick Baker style.
I found it interesting to see how much I move.
White Oil Paint on Black Canvas- Werewolf Painting by Rick Baker:  
Oops ,Here is the #WerewolfOfLondon #OilPainting that I did this evening  
#FullMoon means paint a #RickBakerised #WerewolfOfLondon after dinner. I videoed the whole process.Don't feel much like editing it though.
Just about finished Beast #OilPainting from #LaBelleEtLaBete Black and White version that is.  
@EmilySerpico I liked your clever use of the hemp. It worked out really well.
@BalliniLaurena 
Yes ,I have the brain of a ten year old boy....I keep it in a jar on my desk.
@BalliniLaurena 
Pretty good for an old guy!
Looks like B&amp;W wins. That was my feeling too and you guys confirmed it. Rob I do think I will print one and color it to see how it looks.
#FaceOff Alan sorry to see u go. I liked yours and I liked the color.Poisonous creatures are often bright colored.Regina and Emily very cool
Caught up with #FaceOff Ben congrats on the win. Loved the horns. Darla face was cool I only wished it flowed into the horns more.
RT @JoshuaHarker: showing with my childhood hero Rick Baker!

#RickBaker...  
Question, My plan for my Beast painting was to do it in color. The B+W was just going to be the underpainting.Now I'm torn,color or B+W?
@D0PEP0PE 
I havent #ZBrushed  in a while as I was so busy moving my studio.
Looking forward to trying the new features in 4R7 though
I saw #MiniMansions at #TheTroubadour last night and thought they were great!!!
Those young fellows have talent.
@JesseMeriwether @DannyWinn68 
Glad to hear it. How tragic that the poor young girl had to go through that. I hope she is OK.Liked B's brain
@D0PEP0PE 
Usually only one at a time but I was waiting for the Son of Frankenstein to dry so I could put on another glaze so I started this
Put in a bit of time this morning on this.#LaBelleEtLaBete #OilPainting 
Still very much a work in progress.  
@DannyWinn68 
Not so much now but use to back in the day .
@DtengtchDebbie I used to paint white on black all of the time . It is fast   to get something blocked out. No color mixing.
@DeniseLeonard17 @jaeraele 
It's been written about already. It is suppose to be the beast from Beauty and the Beast
@TeknicolorTiger 
I sketched directly with the white oil paint  and brush on the black canvas. No pre sketching in charcoal or pencil
My other painting needs to dry some,so I started this after dinner. Just white oil on black canvas.#OilPainting  
@JesseMeriwether 
Poly foam makes poison gas as it foams up. respirator and use outdoors or B could get really sick!!!
@JesseMeriwether 
Polyfoam does not need to be baked, latex foam does.
 IMPORTANT,if B is using polyfoam she must have a respirator !!!
My #SonOfFrankenstein #OilPainting is  almost done.I decided to look at in in B+W as I have been adjusting the values  
@Svengoolie 
I did ,Sven,thanks. Pretty cool!
@Svengoolie 
Hey Sven, thanks for showing House of Horrors. Rondo is on my list of guys to paint and this was very helpful.

If you design you know the answer. It's of utmost importance.
Congratulation @loganladdie on your win. #FaceOff 
I wish I could have spoken to all of the contestants  that day of filming .
I don't think I have ever heard my name mentioned so many times in one hour before as I did on #FaceOff  tonight.
@JesseMeriwether 
B is going down a dangerous path,scaring her friends parents.
Been there done that.
Parents didn't appreciate my pranks.
The best part of being on #FaceOff  hanging out with @mckenziewestmor and my friends Ve, Neville and that Alien guy,  
Dreaming is good. I followed my dreams and it worked out well for me.Yes I have had some shattered ,those times just made me work harder.
The worse part about being a judge on #FaceOff  is you have to send someone home.
I didn't like being a part of shattering someone's dream.

This is what the majority of the shots look like.I was hoping for step by step shots of the makeup.Not ones like this  
I set my camera to take time-lapse photos while I made up Veronica .
Most of the shots were of my ponytail.  
@TheRickBaker 
What a poser
Almost finished #HunchbackOilPainting  
@mixta110 Oils.
I started a video of the painting process but filled up the card in my camera and stoped.  It kind of destroys the moment .

Painting and sculpting both digitally and real world
@NormanCabrera9 
Norman,congrats on your well deserved #MakeupArtistMag article.
When I saw your work as a kid I knew you had what it takes.
C-up of my #Hunchback #painting still not finished but getting closer.Am I posting too many work in progress images?  
Started my #HunchbackofNotreDame  #oilpainting a week ago.Holidays cut into my work time.Coming along but still a WIP  
My daughter Rebecca is home so I didn't paint  much today.Wanted to see it in B+W to judge values. Lots to do still.  
@JesseMeriwether 
Patience is hard to learn but,it is as important  as artistic skill if you want to do this type of work.
@Loffz @Barry_Cinematic 
I was thinking more like "why was I not made of stone like thee."
@Burtonish_ 
One of my favorite films , make ups,and actors too. Laughton was brilliant in this .
@JesseMeriwether 
I love that she is so self motivated. Way to go Bella!
Not much time to paint today so I just concentrated on the face trying to get the likeness better. Lots to do still  
How it looks after today.
It is my departed mothers birthday today.Those are her face casts in the BG.
Happy Bday Mom  
To celebrate moving out of my large studio, I started a painting. Just sketched in here. More images to come as I go  
@JesseMeriwether 
Looks like she is starting a Grinch.I see that she has a couple of proper  modeling tools now.I like that she is so driven
Went to the premiere of #TheHobbit last night really enjoyed it. I think it is the best film of the series.  
Having  dinner at Club33 at Disneyland with my friends,Arjen Tuiten, Mickey,Roy Disney,Minnie and my beautiful wife  
Wow I feel so special. Thanks for all of the birthday wishes. I had the best birthday at Disneyland yesterday.Lots of fun!!!
Thanks everybody for reminding me that I am so old : )
Seriously though, I appreciate you thinking of me on my birthday.
@JesseMeriwether 
Really thin latex,added to the foam latex appliance after cast.
American werewolf was made in the pre silicone days.

 I have been moving for 11 months now, so close to being done.
Cant wait to be creative again.
Yep,I guess it has been announced, I'm finally going to be on #FaceOff
I saw #Sideshow on Broadway. Thought it was great. #BillCondon did a fantastic job everyone did. Loved Lou and Dave Elsey's freaks.

Happy birthday dad,I miss you.
A painting that I did of my dad in 2001 back when he was still alive.  
Had a little photoshop fun with a photo that I took of Veronica in her Halloween make up.  
My wife took this cool shot of Veronica in the make up chair on Halloween .The make up is not quite finished.  
@JennRoseFX 
Hi Jenn, have you played the theremin since? That was a good day.
You wouldn't recognize the shop now. Almost all gone now.
@agraphafx too late it's all gone now.
The make up is all paint no appliances. Really meant to be seen through the vail but thought you might want to see what is underneath.
Just retweeted this from Veronica's twitter but I want it in my photos so here it is again. BTWuncovered photo coming  
Because of the massive job of moving and downsizing my shop,I was declaring this a non halloween Veronica talked some sense into me.Im glad.
photos in a bit. I feel so lucky,ever since I was a kid I hoped that some day I would have kids to make up on Halloween. I love it so much!
Happy Halloween! It's four am and I  am up so I can make up my daughter before she goes to work. This is Halloween this is Halloween.

@dinarosecima 
Dina, your Aphrodite make-up and severed head were outstanding! I was blown away by them both.Congrats! I'm impressed!

@cordisruption Gee I don't think that I have ever been described as divinely wonderful and amazingly groovy before. Thanks
@burns84_burns 
I wish, but no Larry Cohen has them all. He says that they are in surprisingly good shape considering there age.
@Svengoolie 
Hey Sven,thanks for the shout,for me and for Charles Gemora who didn't receive credit as the gorilla. Even the dog got a credit
@HopieChangey 
No need to apologize , I was hoping that I had a long lost sister.
@HopieChangey 
You must be mistaken as I am an only child, no siblings
Me at 15 making a bat in my bedroom. This is before my bedroom was full of work tables. I actually had a bed.  
Tiny Ron in a test make up as Lothar from #Rocketeer. An obvious attempt to make Tiny look like Rondo Hatton  
@dinarosecima 
So far I have really liked every thing that you have done. You also have a really good vibe. Keep it up.
@mckenziewestmor 
Loved the evil twin.
 It was great seeing you the other night at the Eyegore awards. You did a great job hosting
@sashaglasser 
Congrats on your win. I really liked your makeup.
@GeorgeTroester 
Nice shorts George!
@illwilledFX 
Yah what's up with that?
@marcsilk 
Actually that isn't the 3D print but my original ZBrush version. A photo of the 3D print is in the beginning of my twitter photos
My glowing head baby from #Starman This was in the pre silicone days and was made out of hot melt vinyl. What a pain  
@thekevinryder 
How true
@KeaghlanAshley 
Hey I didn't think that you should have gone home for your snake makeup I liked it! Hope you didn't let it discourage you.
@TraviataJones 
Congrats, may your marriage me a long and happy one. I like your taste in films
@officialDannyT @Rodriguez @Slash

@MissLaneyC @HorrorNights 
It was nice to meet you .
Good job on the maze
@cigneutron @HorrorNights 
I was just pretending. Who r u ?
Actually I very much liked your snake GI Joe creature
@Slash @officialDannyT @Rodriguez 
Agreed,except for the old white haired guy with the pony tail.
Are you in there John? Here I am removing the #Schlock make-up.
Tonight I get to present John with an Eyegore award.  
@pantheria850 thanks! I appreciate it.
@alycait39 Thanks for setting her straight.
Me in my Bedroom workshop in the early70's sculpting  monster hands.  
@miamaestro Because I didn't know you cared. If I come back as a Strigoi  I will be happy to talk about it.
Making up #MichaelJackson as the WereCat for #Thriller. I never forget watching the Zombie dance for the first time.  
@Vuttu hope I come back as a strigoy.
@BryanWynia thanks Brian,how's it going?
@msmonster 
Not much left of those locks though. Hey Ms. Nice to hear from you.
Here is an earlier stage of the Judy Greer transformation for the version of Cursed that I worked on Again not used .  
@zaynerd_ 
Don't grow up. I didn't .
@wolfmansgtnards 
Clean up was a lot easier though. No blood to wash off.
@djwagner_danny 
What were you doing snooping around in my stuff?
Actually thanks for your help moving out.
@Nevermint 
All got boxed up when the film shut down.It started up again and it was all given to the new make up FXGuys who changed it.
@ToontownJuggalo 
We'll actually this was a stunt girl .
@BalliniLaurena 
Happy nineteenth birthday Laurena! And beast wishes
Rick
The almost transformed Judy Greer Werewolf for Cursed. The film I worked on was shut down.My worked changed or unused  
At least in my mind I am.
I had fun, but froze my butt off.
Why is it that they always kill me in my cameos?
That wasn't me in TheStrain ,I am much younger, better looking ,and a better actor that that old ponytailed guy who was in last nights show.
RT @CarltonCuse: What could be my favorite ep. of THE STRAIN this season is this Sunday. And not just for the Rick Baker cameo. #TheStrainFX
RT @JesseMeriwether: BELLA at Frends: Hi! @TheRickBaker told me 2 get monster clay.  CLERK: Sure - just go upstairs and Elvis can help u. h…
RT @JesseMeriwether: @TheRickBaker - Thank u so much. Bella had time of her life. Tho - her lil sis is now official guinea pig. &lt;3  
My first job working at #CLOKEY . I worked on Gumby and Davey and Goliath. Notice my name on the poster I painted.  
Here is another of my Pre Production designs for #MALEFICENT  
@JesseMeriwether 
I have put together a make up kit and some supplies for Bella, How am I going to get it to her.
Speaking about Dick at his memorial today was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. He got a lot of well deserved love today.RIP Dick
#JimHenson #JohnLandis and me on the set of the Muppet Movie  
My daughter Rebecca is 21 today. I can't believe it. Happy birthday
Rebecca! I'm so proud of you.
To all of the Dick Smith fans out there,this Sunday at ten am at the motion picture academy in the Sam Goldwyn theater is Dicks memorial.
@JesseMeriwether 
Today is my Daughter's birthday how funny.
Bella did a great job in both her acting and make up effects. Well done!
@elstreeproject ok what?
@sgorelick 
Steve, wow it has really been a long time.how are you holding up old timer?
Rest in Peace my dear friend.
#DickSmith the greatest make-up artist ever!  
The master is gone. My friend and mentor Dick Smith is no longer with us. The world will not be the same.
Here I am as a teenager in another werewolf make up. I WAS a teenage werewolf.  
@JimMcPherson1 
Good eye Jim. Yes it was a casting of my design sculpt for figs which I painted to try and figure out his paint scheme.
@pantheria850 
Thanks,
Actually the cheekbones are mostly prosthetics
My workroom on #Greystoke in a stage at #ElstreeStudios. Matching up the multiple  Silverbeard heads.  
@ChaplinsCane 
Yah I was trying to figure out what I was looking at in my hand. Must be some sort of reference material.
@DestrysDad 
It's pretty easy I just look in the mirror.
@Burwell_Lois 
Nice to see you on the show, looking forward to seeing you more.
Sculpting Jack stage three make up, the one that I previously posted Griffin lounging in from #AmericanWerewolf  
@mckenziewestmor @Burwell_Lois 
First I have to say how gorgeous you looked in that red dress.
 I enjoyed seeing Lois,I love her look too.
@shinichiwakasa No Shinichi,it was jus some water based clay that was available in England at the time.
@JesseMeriwether She should watch this,  
@JesseMeriwether 
She could but it will stiffen them up some. Maybe mix a little acrylic paint for color
and some red yarn pieces for veins.
@MutinyCo 
Yes at the time there were no good plasticines available in England. I quite enjoyed working in wet clay though.
Sculpting a test head for #Greystoke .The Greystoke heads were all sculpted in water based clay.  
@flipcritic @akstanwyck 
Thanks for the shout out.
@ToddMasters 
Yes , a cast of the idiot who played Kong.
@agraphafx 
At about this point. Once I can see how it will look finished ,then I carve down the sculpted hair.
@robertslover55 
I would love to see it if it were done right.They need people involved who love the originals,like a monster kid makeup guy
Here is a shot of my 76 #KingKong head sculpt not quite finished but close.  
Back in the day when I use to use real paint to do my designs, White eyes from #Greystoke  
@HOMOHUMANUS 
They also made the miniature trees in the same shop. That is why the shop is full of branches.
The man who would be Kong. A not so good Polaroid of me in the #76KingKong 
suit without the head.  
@brendanpascal 
Hi Brendan,was that you? Do you have a photo of it? I actually received quite a few drawings like that back in the day.
@JesseMeriwether I Love this girl! If she is in the LA area I would love to show her my studio,answer questions, and give her some supplies.
#AmericanWerewolf shot for Bella,This is how we did it.  
@JesseMeriwether @GulfCoastLawyer 
Please tell Bella that her note and photo made my day,no my year.
I'm very impressed and flattered by it.
@GulfCoastLawyer I love this! Thank you!
@gregaronowitz @Zombie360x  cool!
My 1st major film #KINGKONG.Graduating from the independents to the glamorous MGM studios Spot my sculpts in the mess  
The very first thing that I did for my very first film was to make this maquette of the #OCTAMAN.  
After a busy day of make up on #theNuttyProfessor I did this out of the kit test make up on #JohnAstin as the judge.  
@zwgman Zach,you piss me off. Chris and I look like old guys and you still look the same.
I think you are really Dorain Gray. : )
Happy Birthday Dick Smith! He is the greatest make up artist ever! 92 years old today.  
@langham87 About the same time.
@LooksPuppety And I look like a dork, like I said it was the 80's.I actually desaturated the color of my sweatshirt before I put this up.
@Though_lovers @stolfatuous @perlmutations Yes that is why I usually don't smile in photos.
@eatonadams Cool!
@ChaplinsCane Ron is great to work with,and no mistakenly got a perm back then.
Here is #RonPerlman in a test makeup 4 #BeautyAndTheBeast I'm the1980's looking guy with the bright sweatshirt.  
@neal_ndk  I would love to see those. Mike was the major creative force behind those make ups. I have seen some of beautiful paintings 4 IDM
@FelDaCougar @hypnobeast  Yah the bastard who did that make up copied me! Oh, wait, I did that make up too. Never mind .
@FelDaCougar
@djwagner_danny   Figured you would like this Danny. Ill have to show you the test make up I did on Bottin . Guess what animal I made him?
@ChaplinsCane  I would have loved to make a bunch of animal men but I don't think I could have handled a job that large then.
@robertslover55  Yes when I did this make up I thought it would make a great Beast. I used a lot of it when I did Ron Perlman's Beast
@robertslover55 actually I think I was saved,the scale of that job was beyond what I could probably do at that time.
I didn't it. Go figure the job went to John Chambers instead of a mid 20yr old
kid. Here ist he Lion man makeup on me  
In the mid 70"s  #TheIslandOfDrMoreau was going to be made.
I knocked out two makeups trying to get the job.1 on me on 1 on Rob Botton.
@agraphafx @ToddMasters  More like Harry growing into John. We would watch dailies at lunch and learn from John's performance.
@ToddMasters   That was flattering.Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
@robertslover55  I try and something creative every day. Sculpt, paint,
Computer modeling, digital painting. It makes me happy.
@Dan_is_Tweeting @ToddMasters  I have never watched this before. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. I look like Santa though.
@MasinAlfredo @ToddMasters  A cable head is make up fx speak for an animatronic head who's expressions are controlled by push pull cables.
@BigSpenWilding  hey Spencer, me too. Still regret not doing a Frankenstein's monster make up on you.
@ToddMasters 
Mostly RC but the big smile coming up from the basement and while laughing at the TV  was a cable head.
@jackhellcats how strange two different tattoos of my creations is less than a week. I bet that two different mothers are really mad.
Touching up #MichaelJackson for the #Thriller transformation. Filmed in my shop.
What a strange position I'm in.  
@paulacker  Excellent!! Looks fantastic!
@Phelimo  It was my film I designed and made the alien,the film was delayed.When It started up again I was working .I recommended Greg
#WithoutWarning The film where I met #KevinPeterHall  I miss Kevin,he was a great friend and a fantastic actor.  
Keeping in the theme of fathers day, this make up was very much based on my wife's dad, here is Eddie Murphy as Saul  
@veronicabaker Thanks honey, I love you too!
Happy Fathers Day!  Me,what's with the face? Bob Burns,practically my dad, and my dad. Happy fathers day dad,miss you  
@ChaplinsCane  I have so much stuff boxed up that it is ridiculous.
@ToddMasters  what dentures?
@magicmikedizzle  I guess so
What it takes to make a bigfoot. Most of the parts for Harry from #HARRYANDTHEHENDERSONS  
Me in a make-up test for one of my lesser known films #RATBOY  
@shinichiwakasa  Nice to hear from you Bob thanks for stopping by.
How is everything in Japan?
@ColinRWebb  Remember that we did it more than 30 years ago and my small crew was on the average 18 years old . We could do much better now.
A painting that I did as a study for #AnAMERICANWEREWOLFInLONDON, before I sculpted the werewolf.  
@ChaplinsCane  Funny when I first read this I thought it said "they are not disgusting looking enough. "
@mudron The original Gremlins was all Chris Walas. He did a fantastic job.
@ThomasSlayer  it was a whole gizmo suit for a little person. In our test period we made a gizmo and gremlin suit .I decided not to use them
Since Gremlins 2 is so much on my mind, here is a shot of my crew during the prototype period of pre production.  
Funny I get up this morning turn on the tv while I have my breakfast and Gremlins 2 is on. How appropriate .
They should get one of these two guys.  
WTF?  
I have officially been a dad for 25 years now.The best 25 years of my life. Look how happy it has made me.  
@JimMcPherson1 Yes Remember Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen  on the tour.
@JAMMYC89 Depends on who was involved .If Landis was doing it, I would love to do the transformation again.We could do it so much better now
@mikrotwit That is cool! Who made it? I want one
@ChaplinsCane It's Veronica's middle name
25 years ago today I was filming Gremlins2 gizmo in the tool box ,when I got a call that my wife went into labor. 6 8 89 Veronica was born.
Sculpting the #FUNHOUSE monster. It's the one on the left, the other one is me.  
#Maleficent Is not the only time I have created a #DISNEYVILLAIN Here is Susan Sarandon from Enchanted.  
#Maleficent horns, which were beautifully sculpted by Steve Koch, were removable and stuck on with magnets.  
My first sketch of Maleficent. I did this before I had the job and met with Angie back in 2012.  
Our Make-up included the horns.Unfortunately my crew Steve Koch, Rob Freitas and Bill Sturgeon didn't appear to get credit on the film.
Malefiecent opens today.Toni G, Arjen Tuiten, and I were responsible only for Angie's Make-up .  
76 #KINGKONG  just standing around on the set waiting for the men working on it to finish so I can do some monkey biz  
Guess where I went with my beautiful family last night?  We enjoyed the movie and Angie was fantastic!!!  
@GeekChocolate Yes the 1981 film.Dick Smith was in charge of the makeups and did some fantastic ones.He asked me to do this last minute one.
I made this over the weekend for a new ending for Ghost Story. After shooting it the came up with a newer ending.  
@HoltChuck Very nit weird :)
@stevethefirst @donttrythis I agree. This was not designed for ET and was suppose to be scary.
@Stanislao_A @donttrythis This was not for ET it was for a Night Skies, a film about aliens who harass and scare a family.
I was so excited to be working on this project,to be able to design different alien characters of the same race.  
Unhappy days,film shut down. I wanted to change the body of the ET,the mantis like arm placement just didn't work imo  
Happy days sculpting the prototype arms for the Night Skies alien back in 1980  
Here was a quick clay sketch that I did in 1980 for one of the nicer younger NIGHT Skies aliens  
@NungGuama 1980 was when I made this.
He does look like Edward G and the others.But painting out the top of the head, adding eyes,and small tweaks.ET"S dad  
As requested The Night Skies alien. Not finished, no eyes. Cover the top of his head and tell me who he looks like.  
#ITLIVESAGAIN  This time with more articulation mostly provided by my arm shoved into it. Hence the pained expression  
I don't know what is going on but for some reason I can't seem to tweet any more photos. Any thoughts about what the problem may be?
#Gremlins2TheNewBatch Being bad in between takes.  
@davidpom2000 Not true, though I did enter a make up contest in FM which never had results. I was very disappointed .
@josepmmir cool! I never realized that there was a Spanish edition . Thanks for showing me. I was really excited to be in FM.
@ckd26238  No I'm the one on the left.
Me posing with the incredably talented #ZacPosen who I had the pleasure of meeting at #MACTrends in Lake Como  
A Polaroid of a #VIDEODROME   Hand gun make up test. A strange but interesting film.  
Getting ready to bite this guys head off #AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon  
@NiloHaq It was lovely to meet you and your friends.
A couple of strange fellows. Me with John Carpenter.Those aren't my real teeth but that is my hair.  
@Joker_Sal  No I hadn't seen it. It's very cool! Where is this from?
They did a good job of duplicating my design. Can't believe it's a cake
I meant loved,but I lived them too.
A copy of a Gogos painting I did when I was 15. I always lived his #FamousMonsters covers  
@Sloopyjon72 I did thank you. It was very cool!
@CreatureShopTV Great job everyone on your 3 day aliens. Impressive,especially for the  short time. Thanks for the shout out Barry.
OK one more for this week. Here I am sculpting my 80's Troll. Started right after we finished American Werewolf.  
I've been posting photos about every day. I figure if I continue I would run out of photos in about 10 years, I better slow down.
Although Jack stage 3 was a puppet,for shots outside the theater it was Griffin in a make up. Griffin waits to go on.  
@SpencerGJackson  Work hard ,don't give up.
@ChaseWoolner @FieldMuseum very cool thanks
@KopelKopel @cgrendy3 @DarkSideIntern @Louis_Tomlinson My inner child is an outie. I refuse to grow up.
@stephdau @donttrythis Good for you! I wish all parents did the same.
@guruglue @donttrythis I think both Adam and I lucked out in the parent department. I know I did. My parents were very supportive .
@donttrythis What a couple of strange and lucky kids. Hey Adam thanks for stopping by.
My name is Ricky Baker,I'm 14yrs old and I made this #werewolf mask. When I grow up I want to make  werewolf movies.  
@JimMcPherson1 they only came out on Sundays. Who is the dork in the photo with you?
Another #MayThe4thBeWithYou photo. As I was painting this mask in my bedroom workshop in my parents house.Years B4 SW  
@Phelimo Neither I made a molds of the original Darth Vader helmet and cast these from those molds. The post helmets were much smaller
@chiltonr The hands were The Incredible Melting Man's hands
#MayThe4thBeWithYou  Darth helmets that I made for personal appearance Vaders for the release of #STARWARS  
@ToddMasters @agraphafx No I am not in the Devil guy and my x wife is not wearing the Emperor make up that I applied. Internet misinfo
@ToddMasters @agraphafx I wasn't sad to see it replaced. I never expected it to show up,except in the BG of a shot.
@fishonfilm Look at the photos that I have posted already many AWW behind the scenes photos posted already.More to come though
Since it's almost #Maythe4thbewithyou Here I am making the Werewolf mask that ended up in #STARWARS years later.  
@djwagner_danny Danny did you ever see the 7th voyage cyclops mask that I made? Jon Berg and I tried to get the rights to sell but
Failed
@RealCliveBarker Ok but I'm kind of scared.
@FlapjackRiley Yes it was meant to be the cyclops from #THEGOLDENVOYAGEOFSINBAD  This one with some alterations also ended up in #StarWars
Nice shirt Rick! I bought it at Save On in the 70's. Posing again, this time with my short lived mass produced masks.  
@MrKamranRaja Yes I watch and like it.
@ChaplinsCane Working on it.
@Lovlar Yah that photo has a lot of product placement.
@D0PEP0PE Thanks for appreciating them.
@DarrylMason Thanks my pleasure.
@NormanCabrera9 Thanks Buddy! I appreciate your responses.
@djwagner_danny Yah Danny today was melting man day for you. From now on May1st is going to be melting man day.
@madmaxmuseum I don't know  but it wasn't me. i think it is cool though.
@IanMcKellen Wait, what, you are following me? You must have made a mistake. I'm honored
#THEINCREDIBLEMELTINGMAN  ME sculpting the stages of the MM.Note my devil mask on the shelf later used in #STARWARS  
@ChaplinsCane Funny I just did a interview for a Japanese DVD of the IMM and I talked about the shot of his ear on a bush looking like pizza
@ToddMasters The hair is great but the face is kind of scary .
@ColinRWebb  It is a lot easier to clean up and to do take 2.on #Videodrome we would would de covered with blood at the end of the day,
@ToddMasters I was running foam them but this is a slip rubber mask
@Dan_is_Tweeting Dan I appreciate all of your responses. Thanks
@RoKurWrld Gee Rok, I guess you are making your way through my photos. Glad you are liking them.
@ANDREYEVSKY @spencer_parsons You guys are cracking me up
@RockatanskyZ You guys are funny
Since I just found out that it is Canadian film day,here is what happened to poor Barry convex in #Videodrome  
@jasperjafx Yes it is a Laughton hunchback mask.On of my all time favorite makeups and performances. I made it for myself because I'm a fan
@ToddMasters When I sculpt I like to see the sculpture with a representation of the hair especially when trying to achieve a likeness.
@MasinAlfredo It was a very creative original story,well crafted by a man much smarter than I am.
@DannyWinn68 I know that I don't have a check mark,how do you get one of those anyways, but yes it is really me, at least I think it is.
Sculpting the Barry Convex head for #VIDEODROME One of the strangest films I have ever worked on with the best script  
@JohnRattacasa It will cost you both arms and both legs, and five bucks.
@doctordestro Yes I still have all three paintings of Jacks three stages.
@AyeQue Jacks stages were always in script by John Landis.
Here I am doing my design painting for Jack from #AMERICANWEREWOLF
 I did this before #GriffinDunne was considered.  
The first mask that I made after meeting #DICKSMITH in the summer of 1969
I was 18years old, but look older here.  
@Casonworld Yes in a Classic Monster Art show at Halloween Town December 2012.I kept the originals but  prints are still for sale there
@NevillePage @Dr_Ivy_Strange Gee thanks Neville. I like your taste:)
Anyone else have problems with the new header being all jumbled up.I want to go back to what I had before or be able to fix this one. How?
Little Kiran Shah     @littlekiranshah  Hey Kiran, How's it going buddy?
@ckd26238 @Dymo69 I added the really overused part so I am the idiot
@BrianShortTN The cops were called when I was shooting an 8mm movie. But I talked the cop into pulling his gun on me and being in the movie
@stevendeknight @noeliacrunch80 Thanks man.
@lifeofreilly For sure I walked through the May Co in at least one make up , but I'm not really sure if it was this one.
“@Dymo69: @TheRickBaker They say the word 'genius' is overused but in your case...”it's really overused!
@_Z__ That was part of the fun,getting peoples reactions.
@TheRickBaker This was one of many times that I walked, in make up, from my parents house in Covina to the Edgewood Plaza to take photos .
Shortly before my film career began I did this make up and walked to my local mall's photo booth to take this photo.  
@NormanCabrera9 Noses run in my family.
@NormanCabrera9 Hate to disagree with you Norman but I think I was created in a laboratory by a Mad Scientist.
@FaceOffSyfy Congrats to all of the finalists.
Way to go Rashaad
I know the photo says Mar.62 but back in the day the film in your brownie camera would stay undeveloped sometimes for years.
10 year old me making the same face as #THERING girl in the closet as I pose with my monster in 1961.Strange boy  
Here is a mask that I made as kid ,it was suppose to be a #FRANKENSTEIN concept, It later showed up the #STARWARS  
@zwgman @NickdeSemlyen @empiremagazine  Great to see you and the rest of the gang.You looked exactly the same as 30 yrs ago. Dorian Greyish
Polaroid of a fitting of the almost finished werewolf from #AMERICANWEREWOLF  Still needs more paint, glue, haircut  
#HarryAndTheHendersons Polaroid of Harry's head sculpt almost finished.
These helped me see the sculpt differently.  
@frawgboy yep,he is the ultimate melting man fan.
@TheRickBaker This one is for you Danny!
#IncredibleMeltingMan shot that I used for continuity when we shot the actual melt. Still has goo stuck all over it.  
@schminkyFX way to go George. Liked your werewolf.
Polaroid taken of the unfinished sculptures for the #AMERICANWEREWOLF transformation.Wanted to see the parts together  
@LA_Review hard to believe that so many future oscar winners worked on that film.
@travislouie yes and the classic Monsters art show at Halloween town.I'm a fan of your work Travis.
@jeffdunham Watched your bio on TV last night.Really enjoined it.Seems like we have a lot in common.
#KINGKONG '76 continuity Polaroid. My big death scene. At least I got to lie down for a while.  
@Vuttu @henningsanden Hey, what's up with that? Actually my face has inspired many a monster.
@NormanCabrera9 More to come Norman. I have some really rare Pollards that I was going to save for my book But I'll post some here soon.
@KirkThatcher @NormanCabrera9 And he is such a good looking and modest older man :)
@elstreeproject Wow 30 years! seems like just yesterday. I spent a lot of hard working but fun hours at Elstree. Wish I could be there.
@vintagecameos @joe_dante I had fun with Joe at the #TCMFilmFestival  we are both such monster nerds.
@RjHaddyofficial Hey RJ,I take it that you just discovered my twitter page ,judging by all of your responses in a row. Glad to have you here
@ToddMasters Hey Todd,it's not everything most of the foam latex appliances aren't in the shot,it most of the big stuff though.
@VintageGt Gee I guess I peaked  at 30.
Me posing with my crew in the old schoolhouse in Richmond England where we worked on #AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon  
@r1a2s3   Congrats on your win this week and last. Impressive ,especially considering the short time frame.
The first thing I did on #Gremlins2 even before I had the job was paint this. I showed Joe while he filmed TheBurbs  
Me thinking ,how do you sculpt a likeness of a guy that doesn't have a profile #AlfredENeuman it drove me #MAD :)  
@malkosh Thanks, I would love to go when is the next one?
@malkosh @ChewyPixels @TheFoundryTeam @pixelised 801 wow , I'm farther behind than I thought. When is it going to be out?
@ChewyPixels @TheFoundryTeam  no this was done with whatever the new version of Modo was back in 2009. I'm still using an older version.
Me building my very first film monster #THEOCTAMAN. My friend Doug Beswick and I built him in Doug's little shop.  
Here I am hamming it up in my barely seen make-up for #THEHAUNTEDMANSION  
Happy Birthday #LONCHANEY .My acrylic painting ,almost finished, of Lon from London After Midnight.  
#SonOfFRANKENSTEIN digital model made in #ZBrush and rendered in #MODO .I did this to test out a new version of Modo.  
Some of the molds that my amazing crew made for #HowtheGrinchStoleChristmas.We did so much work on that film.  
@TheRickBaker Thanks for your response to my very personal piece.
Something different ,a #digitalpainting that I call Last Days. I was traumatized by my dad's death,and did this.  
Me happily at work on my 2nd film #SCHLOCK .Little did I know what an impact #JohnLandis would have on my life.  
@KirkThatcher Enjoyed the show,and like your new look. I always think you as the punk on the bus. Now you are the old hippie man.
@WonderbandMan Congrats on yet another win. You are kicking some butt ,man
Here is our #MIGHTYJOEYOUNG . After #RAYHARRYHAUSEN saw Joe in person he sent me the greatest note. Miss you Ray, RIP  
Me,the poser,with my #GREYSTOKE sculptures.I sculpted these 6 at the same time so I could define their characters.  
@SteveNiles thanks man! Very cool!
@ToddMasters  Hey Todd,watching #Slither.Forgot how much fun it is.
Great make-up FX,perfect blend of visual and makeupFX. Need more like it
@Svengooliebeing Being followed by Svengoolie is a great honor for me. I watch you every week, Monsterkids should stick together.

@TiffGiamm Oh poor Tom does that mean he will look like me when he gets old?
@silviamg Yah what happened? I was young once.
@kevin_briot 21 or 22
@SongWarmonger I lucked out big time in the parent department. They fully supported my strange hobby which turned into my strange profession
@TheRickBaker I'm the one on the left.
Here I am in the early 70's sculpting the #ITsALIVE baby in my bedroom of my parents house.  
@one_vazquez Who is Reggie Jackson:)
@jodamico1 @jesse_hamm We actually see some of our aliens that didn't make the cut in the film in this clip.Thanks for posting .
@jesse_hamm @jodamico1 Yes mine too .Great design by Ron Cobb.
@jodamico1 @jesse_hamm  Both masks that I made way before Star Wars but used in the cantina scene.
@AstoryintheEnd Yep we made the giant bat and I was so sad to see the scene cut because it was cool!
My Bat Demon mask made in the early'70's used here in #BobBurns halloween show in "74.He appeared later in #StarWars  
@ncrystaldiana  Thanks Crystal, Jack Pierce inspired me too. Being a make up artist was my dream from the time I was 10,and it came true.
RT @Maleficent: "Well, Well."  
Me in the first #Wolfman make up test which I did many months before filming.  
@Villafanestudio hey I just watched your show, and I was totally impressed with what you all did. Excellent work!
I just watched  #carvers Those guys did some really cool stuff!  I was very impressed.
@puckheadTO Yes I think it was the high water mark of Stan Winston's brilliant
career.
@seknewburn Had a great time visiting with you and your guys.  Got home safely though I am a bit sore from the vampire attack.
@ToddMasters thin slip latex applied to the edge of the foam app. Sprayed the blood with H2o to keep wet. The weight of the water jiggled it
@RJ_RedneckJedi I did sculpt them myself only I sculpted them digitally. Not cheating!
@Necrotek no scanner they are all #ZBrush models most of them from years past. Printed on my #makerbotreplicator2
More #3Dprints from my #makerbot obviously unpainted and in various stages of cleanup.  
@ToddMasters I probably shouldn't admit it but,those jiggly bits were a happy accident. Oh wait no I planned it from the beginning.
@webdesignfarm hi Bobbi it's been a long time. Please give my regards  to Joni and her family
@GrisGrimly hey cheers Gris! Nice to hear from you.
My wife took this cool shot of my star being made. I still find it hard to believe that I have one of these.  
@KirkThatcher  Thanks Kirk, looking forward to the Henson show.
@BhHand  Thanks, I try.
@ChynaChyna_ Only thirty one years worth of films. You should have picked a younger make-up artist.
Well #Dracula needs a #Frankenstein .I did this #ZBrush image to celebrate 1year of using Zbrush back in '05  
Here is my #BelaLugosi  #CountDracula modeled in #ZBrush rendered in #MODO .  
@JovankaVuckovic  that's great!
@MAC_Gregory_A @adventuremandy  I just assumed that I was the beast

#GlennShadix in his first make-up test for #PlanetOfTheApes I thought he was great as Senator Nado.

A fav actor to work with #VincentDOnofrio as Edgar from #MIB . He was great in the chair and fantastic in the film.  
@Sentimental205 Looked you up in a year book. Remembered the face right away.
I was on the same page disguised as J.Masters.
One of my personal favs #HarryandtheHendersons My first radio controlled #animatronic mask.I miss #KevinPeterHall  
@DarthMaximos Cool but it doesn't look much like a werewolf:)
@RosseyWrath Nothing like it did  back in the golden age of make up effects.Unfortunately.
@kylebriot When I was a kid. I decided that I wanted to be a make up artist when I was 10.  53 years ago . No wonder I look so old.
@DaBearHinman @veronicabaker They grew up in a house full of monsters.That is normal right?
@veronicabaker @joe_dante  That's one cute baby! That thing in the jumpsuit next to it isn't bad either :)
@BeautyEFX @WonderbandMan   Harry had two eyes and didn't have a mouth on his stomach .
@entractemg   A rubber band
@entractemg Or Janis Joplin
@entractemg Or Led Zeppelin
@magicbilly The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
@BeautyEFX @WonderbandMan Yah congrats to both of you.
#GorillasInTheMist Me with a fake Digit and fake Dian Fossey 11 thousand feet up the mountains in Africa.  
@adrianmarley @AnneBillson I like that there is a new way to achieve effects especially when it is something that we can't do with rubber.
@ChynaChyna_ I approve of your choice!
I'm sure some of you have noticed that I am much better at make up than spelling.
@Scott_Ian  Hey Scott, haven't seen you since Halloween.
@BOGLIN5150 They have grown to expect it.
@linndy98 Imposible, she could hardly breathe.
@sethgs Cool! Both of my daughters went to Emerson.Rebecca is still there. Hey have you seen this version?

Another fun film to do #AmericanWerewolf Landis pushing me while I operate the wolf for the Piccaddilly circus scene

@AdrianRigby1000 just don't aim at me:)
@cyberaug my pleasure. thanks for the shout out to the FaceOff fans
@DaBearHinman bless them!
@BalliniLaurena Hi, Paris is beautiful.That is where I was in the photo of the half painted zombie.
I prepping to do a make up this weekend on my daughter Veronica as Miss Shock Bob Burns classic form the late 50"s
Thanks guys, glad to see some make up people following . For a while it seemed to be mostly digital followers
Here is the finished Zombie all paint #makeup. Different straight nosed guy. Costume by the fabulous Lou Elsey.  
@Brad_Is_Writing When I finished they said that it was an amazing demo . Who knew, I wish I did I would have finished the makeups better.
@Brad_Is_Writing Actually the audience , european ,middle eastern,and Russian were very quiet. So much so that I rushed through the demo .
@DaBearHinman His nose was perfectly straight.
@jaysbord I would be too nervous! If I screw up with a makeup,which I do now and then ,I can just wipe it off and start again.
@MrCamW Your too late to be the first in line there are already a few hundred who have claimed that position. Now if I just had a book .
@LaughingPsycho @MrCamW I don't think that they are being arseholes ,I think they just don't realize how popular makeup is.
Me demonstrating a Zombie paint only #makeup for MAC class. Painted half off stage half in front of audience.  
Me as #Ygor. This photo was mistakenly used a number of times as the real #lugosi as Ygor  
@MrCamW When a publisher decides to publish it. 2 have turned it down because they say there is no audience for it.
@ToryBelleci @twitter @veronicabaker Hey Tory,thanks for spreading the word. Whenever someone calls me a legend it makes me feel really old.
@masoncole62 you'll be hearing from my lawyers.
@Darth_Dadeous @FaceOffSyfy My fault I have said no when they asked but now I am reconsidering.
@Tori_Bedford I'm a big fan of both of them.
@MrCamW Sure but I have to save some surprises for my book
@robthomasbrown They expect it. My girls have been going to school in make up for halloween since kindergarden
@EricVespe Hi Eric, I have been doing this stuff for 53 years ,I better be good by now.
My daughter Rebecca Halloween 09. She went to school like this.  
@headgeek666 I would love to do Brian Cranston as Lon Chaney in a remake of man of a 1000 faces and do all of the classic Chaney makeups
@headgeek666 Fantastic film! Great example of that magic that can happen with an amazing actor in an equally amazing makeup.
@headgeek666 Hi Harry ,yah for sure but I think I have to do the Laughton huncback first
Some of my #classicmonsters paintings. A few if this first series are not shown.
I'm feeling the need to paint more.
