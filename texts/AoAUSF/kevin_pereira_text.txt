@darksolid @TheEverhigh @ASUS Yup. Full price hold, and $30 more for expedited shipping, or else it may have been weeks to get a new unit!

Hubert the plastic goldfish was ungrateful. I shouted at him for about ten minutes. Web extra? Some day. #HackMyLife
@jdickson93 Was just thinking that. I'd red-shell some fools.
Cameras plus locker room equal violation of my court order. But, these hacks work. I've used panty-liners for hosting-nerve-sweats!

I suppose fingers are viable substitutes for some of the pen-hacks, but that's way less fun. Raid your office supply closet and hack-at-it!
I ruined a marriage with that hack. But statistically, it only had a 50/50 shot. So, I still sleep at night.
During the ponytail challenge I scribbled all sorts of stuff on the clipboard. I'm not surprised it didn't make it to air. #LoveMeDaddy
Hack Fact: The ponytail challenge was the first shoot of the season. The vacuum hack also works on Portuguese chest-hair.

@markrar @brucegreene @Marinello_Jam @adamkovic @JustRiggz @InsideGaming I AM, INDEED, BOTH VERY FUNNY AND VERY COOL. THANK YOU.
@bdgrabinski It's disgusting to charge that much for one raid, a handful of items and more of the same tedium. I'm over the grind.
@Tomarik Enjoyed the core game. Got enough hours out of it to justify the price. Definitely not the case with the DLC. To understate it.
@Insanefatman To me? It is. Overpriced. Wash, rinse, repeat design. Thin on content. Bounties are total chores. Tedium.
Buying the Destiny DLC was a mistake. A mistake I knew I was making, but a mistake nonetheless. #Sadface #OverIt

Tweeting the @truTV Hack My Life premiere next Tuesday; considering a live Twitch stream. Want to hang/chat with @breagrant and me?

@ajoy34 Crazy. But I think I follow. Thanks for the tip. Adjusting the rig accordingly.
@Hoverboy That's what everyone is yelling at me to do...
@ajoy34 Was opting for the 8GB to help future-proof a bit... you still think dual 980s?
Ugh. Nvidia or AMD? So conflicted. Leaning towards a dual Titan Black setup, but that R9 295X2 8GB though...

RT @xeni: "Stop videotaping!"‚Äî#Ferguson police to @WesleyLowery before they arrest him. Video:  
@Eidolon01 That's not entirely true. It can escalate a situation just as much as it can deter one from occurring.
RT @Stubbs6foot8: Top Story. @kpereira #Ferguson  
@agohl_LS NO. Reminding people that the widespread use of agent provocateurs means nobody should leap to judgement and always look deeper.
@Defenestrator1 Local police planted many provocateurs nationwide during Occupy. If they can afford tanks, they can afford under-covers.
@ThatNateClark Agreed. It's also hard to hear an order to disperse, let alone acknowledge one peacefully, when your eardrums are bleeding.
@jaywesty72 Agreed. It pains me to see lives in danger on either side. Events like these are confusing, tumultuous and frightening.
@erby1kabogey @jaywesty72 I know. But it's hard to explain that in just 140 characters.
@thehilblog Can't even what? Google it? Here's one result:  
.@jaywesty72 *I REPEAT* I am NOT saying that happened tonight, but research the use of agent provocateurs during the recent Occupy protests.
@thehilblog Yes. Agent provocateurs were used all over the country during the Occupy protests. Plenty of video evidence if you search.
ONE undercover operative lobs a rock and an ENTIRE assembly can be fired at. Not saying it's the case tonight, but important to remember.
Deafening sonic weaponry is a great way to disperse people - as well as disorient, confuse, panic and endanger them.
@CreamyItalian32 No. Criminals did that. Peaceful protesters peacefully protest. It's irresponsible and dangerous to conflate the two.
I'm hoping for peace and safety tonight in #Ferguson for protestors and law enforcement alike. Issues need addressing but not with violence.
RT @PDPJ: #Ferguson picture from earlier in the day, high powered rifles trained on protesters
